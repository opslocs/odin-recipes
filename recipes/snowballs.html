<h1>Snowballs</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snowball cookies are technically called Mexican wedding cakes or Russian teacakes,
  but my grandmother gave up on us calling them that years ago! With a rich,
  nutty flavor from finely chopped pecans, and a sweet, powdery coating from
  confectioners' sugar, these tiny, buttery treats are truly the most delicious
  melt-in-your-mouth morsels.
</p>
<p>These snowball cookies are simply irresistible. It's sure to become
  a go-to during the holiday season, but you'll want to make this
  snowball cookie recipe all year long.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
  <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Beat butter, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer
    in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt
    until completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and
    place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
  </li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown
    but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes.
    (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)
  </li>
  <li>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.</li>
  <li>Place 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a shallow bowl; roll hot cookies
    in sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool. Once cooled,
    roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.
  </li>
